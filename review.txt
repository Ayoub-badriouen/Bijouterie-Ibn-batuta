Consistency in Dropdown Menus:

Your product and contact dropdowns are functional, but ensure each dropdown has unique id values (e.g., product-dropdown-menu, contact-dropdown-menu) to avoid conflicts.
Footer Addition:

Add a footer section with links to social media or contact details, aligning with the catalog's theme.
SEO Enhancements:

Include meta tags for better search engine visibility, such as descriptions and keywords related to "Moroccan jewelry."
Optimized Images:

Compress images for faster loading while maintaining quality. Use alt attributes with meaningful descriptions for accessibility.
Responsive Design Adjustments:

Add more @media queries for better usability on smaller screens, especially for the dropdown menus.
Dynamic Dropdown Functionality:

Use JavaScript to toggle dropdowns smoothly. Hereâ€™s a simplified version:
javascript
Copy code
function toggleDropdown(menuId) {
    const menu = document.getElementById(menuId);
    menu.style.display = menu.style.display === 'block' ? 'none' : 'block';
}
Categorical Descriptions:

Add a brief description for each category in the product section, highlighting the uniqueness of Moroccan earrings, rings, necklaces, etc.
Cultural Touch:

Add traditional Moroccan patterns or motifs as subtle background elements for better thematic integration.
Contact Links:

Ensure links for Instagram, WhatsApp, and Mail open in a new tab using target="_blank".
Accessibility Enhancements:

Add ARIA attributes (aria-label, role, etc.) for better screen reader support.
